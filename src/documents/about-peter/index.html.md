### Why did you decide to become an author?

To be honest, I wasn't much good at English when I was at school. But when my son was little, I used to tell him bedtime stories about an inventor called Professor&nbsp;P, to help him get to sleep at night. Then, when my son was seven years old we bought a caravan and parked it at Golden Cap in Dorset. We had so much fun finding fossils on the beach that it gave me the idea for a Professor&nbsp;P story. After I'd started writing, I just couldn't seem to stop...

### When did you start writing?

I started writing in March 1999. By July 1999 I had finished my first (unpublished) book, **Professor&nbsp;P and the Time Machine** and I gave it to my son for his ninth birthday (on 4 July 1999).

### How long did it take you to write your books?

It took me five years to complete **Professor&nbsp;P and the Jurassic Coast**. I kept revising and altering the story until I was happy with it. I took about 3 years to complete **Professor&nbsp;P and the Jurassic Island**. I'm getting quicker!

### When did you start collecting fossils?

I stated collecting fossils when I was eleven years old. My father took me to a quarry near where I lived (in Sevenoaks, Kent) and we made some amazing finds.

### Why did you create the character of Professor&nbsp;P?

The character of Professor&nbsp;P is based on myself. Like Professor&nbsp;P, I studied at Cambridge and lived there for many years. I am also an inventor and I've designed many electronic and computer products. In many ways Professor&nbsp;P is the character I would like to be! I'd love to make a real time machine and explore the world of the dinosaurs...

### What have you invented?

Most of my inventions are to do with electronics and computers. When I lived in Cambridge in the 1980's, I founded a company (Cambridge Computing Limited) to sell my inventions - these included a digital oscilloscope, a programmable joystick interface, a high resolution graphics card and an EPROM programmer. More recently I've been involved in designing simulators and control systems for tunnelling and directional drilling machines.

### Who is your favourite author?

As I child, I used to love Enid Blyton, especially the Famous Five series. I tried to recapture the innocence of her books in my writing, while bringing the stories up to date with modern technology.

### Where are the best places to find fossils?

There are many excellent fossil sites in the UK. The Dorset coast is especially good, particularly around the Lyme Regis area. The North Yorkshire coast is another excellent location and you can find many Jurassic fossils in the Scarborough and Whitby area.

### I would like to become an author, can you give me any advice?

It’s a good idea to keep a notebook to write down all you ideas - then every so often you can look over what you've written and you’ll find you have new thoughts and like a jigsaw, you can fit the pieces together. It's also important to really believe in your characters, to know them and care about them. Sometimes it’s even worth writing down background information that you may never use in the actual story. When you really know your characters you’ll find that the story is much easier to write.
