> Great book! My first pupil (yr 5 age 10) finished it in one and a half days (including surreptitiously in lesson times e.g. maths), reckons it to be better than H.P., and is desperate to read the next in the series. I enjoyed it as well! We would love you to come and talk to us/ work with us. Contact us if you can!

I had such an enthusiastic response at Creech St Michael Primary School! Thanks to Amelia and Alex in Year 5 for sending me such wonderful pieces of writing after my visit.
