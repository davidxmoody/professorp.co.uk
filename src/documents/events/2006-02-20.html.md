> We really enjoyed your visit and offer our heart-felt thanks. The children in year 6 suggested that we read the book together in class. To hear about you life and your interests and how your son has inspired you to write, was inspirational and the children thoroughly enjoyed meeting and listening to you, as did the staff. We wish you every success in the future with your next book...
