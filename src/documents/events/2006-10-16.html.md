> Thank you for coming in and reading to Year 6. We all enjoyed it! I especially enjoyed looking and touching the fossils. My favourite fossil was the sharks tooth. I think your book is great, especially the talking toaster. Right now I'm reading Professor P and the Jurassic Coast. I think it's brilliant!...
