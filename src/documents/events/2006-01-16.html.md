> Just a quick note to thank you for your visit. The children and staff really enjoyed it and I now have a group of children reading your book in class. The photograph is great and is being put up in a prominent place in the library and the Bournemouth Echo also published it. I will certainly recommend you to other schools in the area. Please keep us advised when of the next book in the series is published...
