> I can't begin to tell you how much the children enjoyed your visit, not just my class, but the other 2 classes as well. They are all now insisting that they have your book as the class story for the rest of the term...

> Thank you so much for coming to our school and for showing us all your amazing fossils. I have heard so much about fossils and now to actually hold one to me, is amazing. Thank you very much for giving us the signed bookmark. Sleepy is so soft and fluffy I just wanted to cuddle her. It was fab to hear Jurassic Coast read in the voices of the person who thought of them. I had never dreamed about how amazing the book could be. I loved hearing your life story and how you became a writer.
