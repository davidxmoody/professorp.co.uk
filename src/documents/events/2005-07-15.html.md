> I did like the book very much because of the way it was written. I like the story plan. I like the idea of a time machine also, I like the fossil guide. I like the way that you keep the reader interested all the time. It keeps you in suspense even at the end. The story is full of adventures. My favourite adventure is when Peter, Tara and Floppy were in the Jurassic Period because it is so unusual. My favourite chapters are the Safe and Shark Attack. It was difficult to put the book down.
