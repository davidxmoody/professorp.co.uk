> On behalf of all the children and staff here at Clyst St Mary Primary School, I would like to thank you for a fantastic afternoon of storytelling adventure, and it is this kind of experience that the children will talk about for a long time...
> 
> It is always encouraging when someone such as yourself is prepared to give up their time to enrich our children's learning experience and bring them something to feed their imaginations. I think you have inspired many of them to take up creative writing. Thank you again for a wonderful experience.
