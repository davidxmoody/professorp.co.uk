> Thank you so much for visiting us today! All the children have been buzzing about your book, fossils and your personal story. My class have been so inspired and enthused by your reading that they were totally silent and focused today when writing their own missing scenes - thank you!
> 
> Both class 2 and 3 said that your book is written in a way that they can understand and that the words are simple, but still help them paint exciting pictures in their heads. All children, from the least to the most able enjoyed your visit and want to write and write themselves! What more can I ask!
> 
> My class particularly empathised with your own feelings towards and difficulties with literacy. Some children said that you have 'boosted their confidence' regarding literacy. One boy said that he had 'given up with literacy', but that you have made him think that it is worth working at! 
> 
> I will be thoroughly recommending your book and your visit to colleagues at other schools and will be sending a report to the Wells Journal and to parents (with order forms!). 
> 
> Thank you again!
