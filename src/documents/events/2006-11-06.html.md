> ...We all had a wonderful time and gained so much from your visit. Several 'novels' are now being worked on around the school. At playtime several huddles of children can be seen reading the latest work! We have also had some fossilised coral brought in for 'Show and Tell' in Year 6.

> You certainly managed to tap into several areas of interest for our pupils. Many thanks again - visits like yours add so much to the enriching experiences we try to give our pupils.
