> Thank you for coming in and giving a wonderful talk about your book. I visited your website, the games were very enjoyable and the deleted scenes were really interesting to read. I loved Professor P and the Jurassic Coast and could hardly bear to put it down... It was brilliant meeting you.

> Thank you for coming to my school. I had lots of fun. I particularly enjoyed listening to part of your book, my favourite character must be Sleepy, the super-active dog! I learnt that you don't need to be a wizz at writing to become a book writer - that's a big relief. I hope you write another book.

> I am writing to say thank you for coming to our school, I really enjoyed it and I found all your fossils interesting, I thought the shark's tooth the best one. I have just bought your book and can not put it down mid way through it, I'm really looking forward to your next book to come out - it sounds fantastic
